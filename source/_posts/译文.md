MARION NESTLE’S heavyweight polemic against Coca-Cola and PepsiCo comes at an odd moment for the industry. Americans are drinking fewer sugary sodas—in 2012 production was 23% below what it had been a decade earlier. Even sales of diet drinks are losing their fizz, as consumers question the merits of artificial sweeteners. From one angle, it would seem that health advocates such as Ms Nestle have won. Yet in America companies still produce 30 gallons of regular (not diet) fizzy drinks per person per year. In many countries, particularly developing ones, consumption is on the rise.
软饮料工业正处不尴不尬之际，马里昂•奈斯特对口可口可乐以及百事可乐的抨击颇具影响力。越来越少的美国人选择饮用含糖碳酸饮料----与十年前相比，2012年含糖碳酸饮料的生产减少了23%。人们甚至也失去了对膳食饮料的亲睐，因为消费者们对饮料中是否添加人工甜味剂提出了质疑。从某个角度来看，像奈斯特女士这样的健康倡导者似乎赢得了胜利。然而，美国软饮料公司每年生产的常规碳酸饮料（而非膳食饮料）人均多达30加仑。在许多国家，尤其是发展中国家，常规碳酸饮料的消费仍呈上涨趋势。
